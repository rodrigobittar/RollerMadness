# RollerMadness


## About
RollerMadness is a course project that displays several instances of Game Design elements within the unity framework, it includes:
- Physics
- Collision Detection
- The concept of a game manager to track score and progress in levels
- And a few more elements of game design

## Installation
The project was exported as a WebGL group of files, as such you will need a modern browser in order to play it, simply download the package and open the **index.html** to play the game.

## How to Play
Control the ball, as you try to collect coins while avoiding enemies that spawn periodically. Use the **W**,**S**,**A** and **D** keys to move **up**,**down**,**left** and **right** respectively.

## Known Issues
Due to the accuracy of the physics engine, if the ball collides with a flat coin at high speeds it will propel itself into the air, this is constantly being adjusted.
